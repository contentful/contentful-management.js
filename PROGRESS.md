### Preview Api Keys - ✅

> Even though they are accessed through a different endpoint, Preview API keys are handled together with Delivery API keys. This means that when you create a CDA key, the corresponding CPA key will be created. A Delivery API key object will contain a link to its corresponding CPA key, which will need to be resolved calling the appropriate endpoint. Preview API keys also cannot be deleted, as they will be deleted along with their Delivery API keys.
