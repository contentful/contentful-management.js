[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) is a content management platform for web applications, mobile apps and connected devices. It allows you to create, edit & manage content in the cloud and publish it anywhere via a powerful API. Contentful offers tools for managing editorial teams and enabling cooperation between organizations.

## Features

- Content management and retrieval through Contentful's [Content Management API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/).
- Built in rate limiting with recovery procedures
- Asset processing helpers

## Supported environments

Browsers and Node.js:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- IE11 (with [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise) polyfill applied)
- Safari
- node.js (4.x, 6.x)

Other browsers should also work, but at the moment we're only running automated tests on the browsers and Node.js versions specified above.

# Getting started

To get started with the Contentful Management JS SDK you'll need to install it, and then get credentials which will allow you to access your content in Contentful.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Authentication](#authentication)
- [Using ES6 import](#using-es6-import)
- [Your first request](#your-first-request)
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
- [Documentation/References](#documentationreferences)

## Installation

### Node:

Using [npm](http://npmjs.org):

``` sh
npm install contentful-management
```

Using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/):

``` sh
yarn add contentful-management
```

### Browser:

If you'd like to use a standalone built file you can use the following script tag or download it from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com), under the `dist` directory:

``` html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/contentful-management@latest/dist/contentful-management.min.js"></script>
```
**It's not recommended to use the above URL for production.**

Using `contentful@latest` will always get you the latest version, but you can also specify a specific version number:

``` html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/contentful-management@1.0.0/dist/contentful-management.min.js"></script>
```

The Contentful Management SDK will be accessible via the `contentfulManagement` global variable.

Check the [releases](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-management.js/releases) page to know which versions are available.

## Authentication

To get content from Contentful, an app should authenticate with an OAuth bearer token.

If you want to use this SDK for a simple tool or a local app that you won't redistribute or make available to other users, you can get an API key for the Management API at our [Authentication page](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/authentication/).

If you'd like to create an app which would make use of this SDK but that would be available for other users, where they could authenticate with their own Contentful credentials, make sure to also check out the section about [Creating an OAuth Application](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/authentication/#creating-an-oauth-20-application)

## Using ES6 import
You can use the es6 import with the SDK as follow

```js
// import createClient directly
import {createClient} from 'contentful-management'
var client = createClient({
  // This is the access token for this space. Normally you get the token in the Contentful web app
  accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
})
//....
```
OR
```js
// import everything from contentful
import * as contentfulManagement from 'contentful-management'
var client = contentful.createClient({
  // This is the access token for this space. Normally you get the token in the Contentful web app
  accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
})
// ....
```

## Your first request

The following code snippet is the most basic one you can use to get content from Contentful with this SDK:

```js
var contentful = require('contentful-management')
var client = contentful.createClient({
  // This is the access token for this space. Normally you get the token in the Contentful web app
  accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
})

// This API call will request a space with the specified ID
client.getSpace('spaceId')
.then((space) => {
  // Now that we have a space, we can get entries from that space
  space.getEntries()
  .then((entries) => {
    console.log(entries.items)
  })

  // let's get a content type
  space.getContentType('product')
  .then((contentType) => {
    // and now let's update its name
    contentType.name = 'New Product'
    contentType.update()
    .then((updatedContentType) => {
      console.log('Update was successful')
    })
  })
})
```

You can try and change the above example at [Tonic](https://tonicdev.com/npm/contentful-management).

## Troubleshooting

- **I can't Install the package via npm**
	- Check your internet connection
	- It is called `contentful-management` and not `contenful-management` Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
- **Can I use it with typescript?**
	- Yes, type definition file coming soon
- **I am not sure what payload to send when creating and entity (Asset/Entity/ContentType etc...)**
	- Check the Content Management API [docs](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/) or the examples in the reference [docs](https://contentful.github.io/contentful-management.js)
	- Feel free to open an issue if you didn't find what you need in the above links
- ðŸ˜± **something is wrong what should I do**
	- If it is a bug related to the code create a GitHub issue and make sure to remove any credential for your code before sharing it.
	- If you need to share your credentials, for example you have an issue with your space, please create a support ticket.
	- Please **do not** share your management token in a GitHub issue

## Documentation/References

To help you get the most out of this SDK, we've prepared reference documentation, tutorials and other examples that will help you learn and understand how to use this library.

### Configuration

The `createClient` method supports several options you may set to achieve the expected behavior:

```js
contentful.createClient({
  ... your config here ...
})
```

#### accessToken (required)
Your CMA access token.

#### host (default: `'api.contentful.com'`)
Set the host used to build the request URI's.

#### hostUpload (default: `'upload.contentful.com'`)
Set the host used to build the upload related request uri's.

#### httpAgent (default: `undefined`)
Custom agent to perform HTTP requests. Find further information in the [axios request config documentation](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios#request-config).

#### httpsAgent (default: `undefined`)
Custom agent to perform HTTPS requests. Find further information in the [axios request config documentation](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios#request-config).

#### headers (default: `[]`)
Additional headers to attach to the requests. We add/overwrite the following headers:

* Content-Type: `application/vnd.contentful.management.v1+json`
* X-Contentful-User-Agent: `sdk contentful-management.js/1.2.3; platform node.js/1.2.3; os macOS/1.2.3`
 (Automatically generated)

#### proxy (default: `undefined`)
Axios proxy configuration. See the [axios request config documentation](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios#request-config) for further information about the supported values.

#### retryOnError (default: `true`)
By default, this SDK is retrying requests which resulted in a 500 server error and 429 rate limit response. Set this to `false` to disable this behavior.

#### logHandler (default: `function (level, data) {}`)
Errors and warnings will be logged by default to the node or browser console. Pass your own log handler to intercept here and handle errors, warnings and info on your own.

### Reference documentation

The [Contentful's JS SDK reference](https://contentful.github.io/contentful-management.js) documents what objects and methods are exposed by this library, what arguments they expect and what kind of data is returned.

Most methods also have examples which show you how to use them.

You can start by looking at the top level `contentfulManagement` namespace.

The `ContentfulClientAPI` namespace defines the methods at the Client level which allow you to create and get spaces.

The `ContentfulSpaceAPI` namespace defines the methods at the Space level which allow you to create and get entries, assets, content types and other possible entities.

The `Entry`, `Asset` and `ContentType` namespaces show you the instance methods you can use on each of these entities, once you retrieve them from the server.

> From version 1.0.0 onwards, you can access documentation for a specific version by visiting `https://contentful.github.io/contentful-management.js/contentful-management/<VERSION>`
